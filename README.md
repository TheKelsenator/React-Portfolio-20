## Description

  Welcome to my single-page application portfolio! This portfolio showcases my experience in building React applications and serves as a comprehensive overview of my skills and projects. Upon loading the portfolio, you'll find a clean and intuitive layout, featuring a header with navigation links to different sections such as About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume. The navigation allows for seamless browsing without page reloads, and each section provides relevant information: from a brief bio and recent photo in About Me, to titled images linking to deployed applications and GitHub repositories in Portfolio, a contact form with validation in Contact, and a downloadable resume with skill proficiencies listed in Resume. Additionally, the footer provides convenient links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and another relevant platform. Explore my work and feel free to reach out with any inquiries or opportunities!
